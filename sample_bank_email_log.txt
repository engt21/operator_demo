INFO     [agent] 🚀 Starting task:
You are a financial advisor's assistant.
Go to http://localhost:8501/ and login with my username and password.
Then, do the following:
Capture the current state of the accounts.
Sell all of Client C's NVIDIA shares and spend as much as possible on MS
If client does not have enough money or shares you should stop and move on to the next step.
You should then return to the main client menu and capture all my client metrics and print them out in a nice simple report.
Finally, when you are done, log out of the website.

Then, go to Gmail and log in with my credentials and draft an email.
When using email interface, when entering who to address it to, each person's email should be entered seperately. After typing each individual person's email, you should type it and then hit enter before proceeding to the next person.
The email must have the following:
Addressee are the following: pradeep.sundaram@morganstanley.com; mainak.saha@morganstanley.com; timothy.eng@morganstanley.com;
You should CC timothy.eng@outlook.com.
The subject should be 'Sample banking transaction with a dummy app - no hands!'
The body should contain, nicely formatted, the client metrics both before and after updated to reflect the changes you executed.
Make an additional note in the body saying Hi! and about how I didn't have to lift a finger to write the email, and about how cool Operator is and how potentially it could be quite powerful, given the correct guardrails.

After doing all this make sure you've set up all the email components I've specified correctly. Do not send the email until all the above conditions have been met.
After doing that, send the email.
Wait for it to send before closing. Check that it shows up in sent mail.
